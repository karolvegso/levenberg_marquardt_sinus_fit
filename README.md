# levenberg_marquardt_sinus_fit
I post here the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for fitting sinus function in C++.

The sinusiodal function is one of the basic non-linear functions. The sinusoidal function is frequently used in optics in interferometry or electronics. To know the low-level algorithm for fitting sinusoidal function can be very useful in X-ray Talbot interferometry or grating interferometry. Here, I post Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm for fitting simple sinusoidal function. The study material and detail explanation of algorithm is posted by Technical University of Denmark by Madsen, Nielsen and Tingleff on the web-page <http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/edoc/imm3215.pdf>. The presented algorithm fits amplitude, phase and offset of sinusoidal function. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm posted here uses Eigen C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. The most important part of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is calculation of Jacobian matrix J(:,:), which conatins derivation of sinusoidal function (x(1)*sin(t+x(2)+x(3)) according to the fitting parameters.
